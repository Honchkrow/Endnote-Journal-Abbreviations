Endnote Journal Abbreviations

The Journal Abbreviations collected from Science and Engineering Journal Abbreviations can be directly imported into EndNote for use.

Due to some journals requiring references to be in abbreviation format, I wrote a script to collect them. This is solely for the convenience of using EndNote for citations. I impose no restrictions on this file; anyone can use it, but I accept no responsibility for any issues that may arise. I will also update it periodically.

Since the data was read using a program from the tbody, there should not be any errors. However, there are some special cases where the full journal name and abbreviation consist of numbers or single letters. This is because these entries are used for indexing, and I believe they will not match any actual journals, so they can be safely ignored.
